      <p class="text-3xl font-serif">Buyer Consultation</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Step 1:  Our relationship will simply begin by getting to know one another. We will share information about our personal and professional backgrounds, the state of the market, local insights, and what Buyer Agency looks like in Washington. In return, we would love to hear about you and your purchasing goals, and answer all your real estate questions. If it feels like the right fit, we can roll up our sleeves and get to work for you!

      <p class="text-3xl font-serif">Financial Pre-Approval</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Step 2:  Unless you are planning on buying a home with cash, your next step is to get pre-approved for a mortgage loan.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Not all professional lenders are created equally. We have several trusted mortgage brokers and lenders that we are happy to refer to you. We recommend interviewing a few to determine which is the best fit and we can walk you through this process. You will then make application with at least one of the lenders and based on a variety of factors including your income, assets, and credit history, they will determine how much money you qualify for. They will then submit your information to underwriting for formal approval and issue a pre-approval letter. Once this is complete, you will be able to confidently set the price range for your search.</p>

      <p class="text-3xl font-serif">Neighborhood and Home Exploration</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Step 3:  We will work together to identify the neighborhoods and property types that are right for your purchasing goals. First, we encourage casual exploration of communities and homes to get a feel for what your day and life could look and feel like in your new neighborhood. Once candidates are identified, we will set up private showings of properties and/or attend open houses to help narrow down the search until we find “the one.” Real estate is not a 9-5 job so we will make ourselves available seven days a week.</p>

      <p class="text-3xl font-serif">Making an Offer</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Step 4:  After you identify a home you are interested in pursuing, we will work together to craft the right offer strategy. We will provide you with market intelligence, comparable property sales, advise you on key strategies to consider, and walk you through the terms and conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Once you are comfortable with the approach and sign the offer, we will submit it. From there, we will work hard on your behalf to get your offer to the finish line.</p>

      <p class="text-3xl font-serif">Escrow and Closing</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Step 5:  Once you are under contract to purchase a home, you will be in the escrow period. During this time, a variety of key milestones will be reached including depositing the earnest money, finalizing your lender and locking your mortgage rate, working through any inspections or other contingencies, receiving the home appraisal from the lender, selecting your home insurance policy, clearing title, reviewing disclosures, gaining final loan approval, signing final paperwork at escrow, transferring funds, and a variety of other potential steps. We will identify a schedule of activities based on your individual contract and closing date and work with you through this process. </p>
