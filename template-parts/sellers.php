      <p class="text-lg">Step 1: The first step in the process is an initial listing appointment. During this meeting,
        we will meet with you at your home and provide information about our professional backgrounds and the state of
        the market. In return, we would love to hear about you and your selling goals, and answer all of your real
        estate questions. We will be as open and direct as possible and believe in a collaborative approach with our
        clients.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">After an initial discussion, we will tour your home and ask detailed questions about the house.
        Once we have a clear picture of things, we will get to work on a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) report, which
        is a custom report for your home.

      <p class="text-3xl font-serif">Determining Value</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Step 2: In order to prepare the CMA report, we will each spend hours mining information, using
        a variety of factors to calculate the value of your home. We balance our research against current market trends
        and conditions, along with inventory levels, interest rates, and current buyer sentiment. We then compare and
        combine our findings to create a comprehensive CMA report, which includes the property valuation, key
        considerations, and recommendations for getting your home ready for market.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Once the report is complete, we will meet with you again to review our findings. We will go
        over any questions you may have, discuss the recommended prep items that will give you the greatest opportunity
        to maximize your returns, discuss what Agency looks like in Washington state and we will begin to form a plan
        for action.

        Whether conducting minor handyman work, installing new flooring, painting your home, coordinating pest
        remediation, refreshing landscaping, installing a new kitchen, or a host of other items, we have a network of
        professional vendors and resources ready to recommend. We will also propose staging options that fit the style
        of the home (or provide suggestions for decluttering and arranging furniture if the home is to remain owner
        occupied). And we will 100% be there along the way to gather bids, manage the work and guide the process. Once
        you have decided on the scope of work, we will develop a key milestone schedule, working backwards from our
        targeted list date so that we are all on the same page with the listing plan.</p>

        the benefits and risks of
        the offer(s). We will review the price, the conditions and the terms and advise you on the overall strength and
        any
        potential red flags. In addition, we will reach out to the lender to confirm the buyer’s financial
        qualifications and
        purchasing power.</p>


      <p class="text-lg">From there, we will work with you to decide how best to respond, including whether to accept or

        a counteroffer. No matter which route you decide, we will always advocate for you and diligently work to gain
        the most
        favorable outcome. Our success lies in your success, which will continue well after you are under contract.</p>

      <p class="text-lg">Step 8: Once you are under contract on your home, you will be in the escrow period. During this
        time, a variety of key
        milestones will be established depending on the terms of the purchase and sale contract and the closing date. We
        will
        identify a schedule of activities such as buyer inspections, contract contingencies, and the lender appraisal,
        and
        provide regular communication updates throughout the closing process. In addition, we will check in with the
        buyer’s
        agent and buyer’s lender regularly to help ensure that things are moving smoothly towards closing.
